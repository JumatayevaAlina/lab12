<font size="7">Aktau</font>
<hr>
<p>Aktau (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_language">Kazakh</a>: Aqtau; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script">Cyrillic</a>: Ақтау) is a city in Kazakhstan, located on the Eastern shore of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. Its current name means "white mountain" in Kazakh, which may be due to its cliffs that overlook the Caspian. From 1964 to 1991, the city was known as <strong>Shevchenko</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language">Russian</a>: Шевченко). Its former name was given due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko">eponymous Ukrainian poet's</a> period of exile in the area.<a href="https://aboutkazakhstan.com/aktau-city">[2]</a> It is located on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangyshlak_Peninsula">Mangyshlak Peninsula</a> and is the capital of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangystau_Region">Mangystau Region</a>.</p>

<p>Aktau is known for its unique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_block">block</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_numbering">address system</a>. Almost no streets in Aktau have names; instead, addresses generally consist of three numbers: the district number (also known as micro-region/micro-district/block), the building number, and the apartment number. This is because Aktau was originally planned as a camp for the workers of the oil industry.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180618230250/http://ogni.kz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5063&Itemid=2">[3]</a></p>

<hr>
<p>The territory of what is now Aktau was once inhabited by ancient tribes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians">Scythians</a>. Archeological finds in the area include old settlements and utensils. The current territory of Mangystau hosted a spur route of the northern silk road, which resulted in the founding of several Sufi shrines in Aktau's vicinity. However, the area had very little population prior to Soviet times and no cities of any relevancy, almost certainly due to the scarcity of fresh water.</p>

<p>In 1958, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium">uranium</a> prospectors settled the site of modern Aktau, naming the settlement <strong>Melovoye</strong> (Меловое) after the bay on which it stood.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324153840/http://www.np.kz/old/2003/08/issled5.html">[4]</a> After the development of the uranium deposits was started, the settlement was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_city">closed</a> and renamed <strong>Guryev-20</strong> (Гурьев-20).[4] In 1963, its closed status was lifted, town status was granted,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">[citation needed]</a> and the name was changed to Aktau.[5] However, in 1964 it was given yet another name, <strong>Shevchenko</strong> (Шевченко), to honor the Ukrainian poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko">Taras Shevchenko</a> who spent 1850–1857 in political exile in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort-Shevchenko">Novopetrovskoye</a>, about 100 kilometers (62 mi) to the northwest. This Ukrainian name for the city may have been granted due to the large number of Ukrainian workers who settled in the city. Their descendants are often easily identifiable to this day with many having surnames ending in '-enko'. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> and Kazakhstan gaining independence, the name Aktau was restored in 1991, but the city's airport still retains SCO as its IATA code.</p>

<p>The Mosque of Chahbagota's most surprising is that Islam has prohibited the depiction of humans or portions of their bodies but the portrayal of man's palm is represented at the walls of this mosque with lotus flowers.<a href="https://samarkandtours.com/kazakhstan/aktau/">[6]</a> </p>

<p>Aktau was once the site of a nuclear power station. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-350_reactor">BN-350</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Fast_breeder_reactor">FBR</a> went online in 1973, and was shut down in 1999. The long-term plans of the Government of Kazakhstan include the construction of a new nuclear power station to be built near the site. In addition to producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium">plutonium</a>, BN-350 was used to provide power and for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination">desalination</a> to supply fresh water to the city. The current station is not considered powerful enough to supply the fresh water and energy needed at this time, and blackouts are a common occurrence.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308052441/http://www.nti.org/e_research/cnwm/securing/bn.asp">[7]</a></p>

<p>Aktau has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktau_Airport">international airport</a> that was built in 1996.<a href="https://aktau-airport.kz/en/about/">[8]</a> Aktau also has a developed seaport.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607155504/http://www.portaktau.kz/eng/">[9]</a></p>
<p>Kazakhstan has been increasing the importance of Aktau's port with its changes in international export policy. It has been attempting to halt the transit of grain through the Black Sea and instead use routes over the Caspian or via Turkmenistan. Aktau's port has been expanded (completion achieved summer 2015) to accommodate ever larger quantities and more diverse types of cargo.<a href="https://en.tengrinews.kz/industry_infrastructure/expansion-of-aktau-seaport-goes-according-to-schedule-260836/">[10]</a> The intent is for cargo to transit by ship over the Caspian Sea and then by rail through Azerbaijan and Georgia for delivery in Turkey and beyond. This new route was made possible by the opening of a railway connecting Georgia and Turkey in 2014.<a href="http://gca.satrapia.com/+kazakhstan-to-leave-black-sea-grain-route+">[11]</a></p>
<p>There is also a railway station Mangystau, about 12 km away from Aktau's city center. Trip from Aktau to Astana will take around 2 days, to Almaty around 3 days.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus">Buses</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi">taxis</a> are the principal means of public transport within the city.</p>

<p>Aktau experiences a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate#Cold_desert_climates">cold desert climate</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification">Köppen</a> BWk), with warm to hot dry summers and cold winters, with a mean January temperature of −0.5 °C (31.1 °F), and a mean July temperature of +25.55 °C (77.99 °F). It is notable that most of the city of Aktau lies below sea level in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Depression">Caspian Depression</a> and is proximate to the lowest point in Kazakhstan and the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">Soviet Union</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karagiye">Karagiye</a>.</p>

<p>The beach season lasts from May to September, with an average sea temperature of +21 °C (70 °F). Aktau has both rocky hills and sandy beaches along the seashore. There are several modern resorts on the coast to the south of the city. The beaches of the Caspian shore are popular in the summer, due to the hot climate of the season. Tourists come mainly from other parts of Kazakhstan. The city has a variety of local hotels and western chains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Hotels">Renaissance</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Inn">Holiday</a> Inn.</p>
